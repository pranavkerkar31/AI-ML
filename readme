Why Numpy over Lists?
1) Speed : Numpy is fater than Lists
2) Memory : Numpy is more memory efficient than Lists
3) vectorization : Numpy is more vectorized than Lists

* Numpy_speed file has the output speed comparison with the lists. 

* Numpy1 file has the Dimension, Range, Matrix Calculations.

* Numpy2 file has the Reshape, Reval, Type Casting, Dimension.

* Reshape, Reval, Flatten file has the Reshape, Reval, Flatten important for matrix calculations.
